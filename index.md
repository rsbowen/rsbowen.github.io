I am a PhD candidate (expect to graduate Dec 2022) at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu), where I am advised by [Ramin Zabih](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/rdz/). I am also a Student Researcher at [Google Research](https://research.google/). I study computer vision; I have worked on a variety of vision problems and am interested in self-supervision, depth estimation, and adversarial learning. Prior to graduate school, I worked in various places in industry, most recently at Google on the VR Jump camera (I am the engineer who is "weirdly" riding a unicycle in [this Wired article](https://www.wired.com/2015/11/youtube-360-virtual-reality-video/)). I earned my BS in math (with honors and departmental distinction) from Harvey Mudd College in 2010. I also [author crosswords](puzzles.html).

## Publications

*Dimensions of Motion: Learning to Predict a Subspace of Optical Flow from a Single Image*<small>  
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01502), [project page](https://dimensions-of-motion.github.io/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R.S. Bowen, R. Tucker, R. Zabih, and Noah Snavely</small>


We developed a new method for self-supervised monocular disparity estimation from a video collection that skips the traditional posing step, by casting depth estimation as a subspace-estimation problem for optical flow.

*Deep Survival Analysis with Longitudinal X-rays for COVID-19*<small>  
[ICCV 2021](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Shu_Deep_Survival_Analysis_With_Longitudinal_X-Rays_for_COVID-19_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf)i&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M. Shu, R.S. Bowen, C. Herrmann, G. Qi, M. Santacatterina, and Ramin Zabih</small>


Using a imaging dataset of early-pandemic COVID-19 patients, we use time-to-event analysis to do automated prognosis from chest x-ray and other data, even in the presence of right censoring.

*OCONet: Image Extrapolation by Object Completion*<small>  
[CVPR 2021](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Bowen_OCONet_Image_Extrapolation_by_Object_Completion_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R.S. Bowen, H. Chang, C. Herrmann, P. Teterwak, C. Liu, and Ramin Zabih</small>

The image extrapolation problem is particularly challenging when the border cuts through a semantic object. We show substantial improvements by using a two-armed pipeline, with one arm specifically trained to complete objects.

*Finding Maximally Informative Patches in Images*<small>  
[NeurIPS 2021 Workshop Paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=IQvu5_MY7aE) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; H. Zhong, G. Balakrishnan, R.S. Bowen, R. Zabih and William T Freeman</small>

We address the problem of finding maximally-informative patches, i.e., a few patches from a given image from which reconstructing the rest of the image is easy.

*Learning to Autofocus*<small>  
[CVPR 2020](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Herrmann_Learning_to_Autofocus_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf), [project page](https://learntoautofocus-google.github.io/) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. Herrmann, R.S. Bowen, N. Wadhwa, R. Garg, Q. He, J.T. Barron, and Ramin Zabih</small> 

Autofocus for mobile-device cameras typically relies on classical algorithms based on, e.g., local contrast metrics. We produce a dataset and demonstrate how to train a network to improve focal-distance estimation.

*Channel Selection using Gumbel Softmax*<small>  
[ECCV 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.04180.pdf)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. Herrmann, R.S. Bowen, and Ramin Zabih</small>

The Gumbel distribution allows us to reparameterize a discrete distribution; we use the so-called straight-through trick for network pruning, either as a model compression step or adaptively at runtime based on the input.

*Robust Image Stitching with Multiple Registrations*<small>  
[ECCV 2018](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/papers/Charles_Herrmann_Robust_image_stitching_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. Herrmann, C. Wang, R.S. Bowen, E. Keyder, M. Krainin, C. Liu, and Ramin Zabih</small>
 

*Object-centered Image Stitching*<small>  
[ECCV 2018](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/papers/Charles_Herrmann_Object-centered_image_stitching_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. Herrmann, C. Wang, R.S. Bowen, E. Keyder, and Ramin Zabih</small>

These two papers address panoramic image stitching in an object-centric way, updating the classic stitching pipeline to better handle moving objects.

## Teaching

I was involved in the creation of [CS 5112](https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/FA21/class/CS/5112), an algorithms class for masters students at Cornell Tech, taught by my advisor. I have also been a teaching assistant for [CS 2112](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs2112/2021fa/), an honors data structures course for Cornell undergrads taught by [Dexter Kozen](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kozen/). As an undergrad, I was a frequent teaching assistant for [CS 81](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/program/course-descriptions/#cs81), the introductory theory course.
