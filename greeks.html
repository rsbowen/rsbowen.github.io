<h1>Greeks and Calculus, part 1: Eudoxus and Dedekind</h1>
</div>
<p>It's fairly well-known among math people that the Greeks were not that far
from the beginnings of what we now call calculus &ndash; for example, Archimedes is
understood to have understood the convergence of geometric series and the
method of exhaustion is very close to what we now call limits. If you squint,
you'll even find integrals. </p>
<p>I have memories of, in my undergraduate math history course, being pleasantly
surprised by some of these examples. However, I haven't found anywhere on the
web which collects them &ndash; that is the purpose of this project. On this page
you will find the details of the similarity between an early definition of
equality of ratios and a millenia-later foundational definition of the real
numbers.</p>
<h2>The Main Players</h2>
<p>Eudoxus of Cnidus was a 4th- and 3rd- century BC Greek mathematician. In
Euclid, he gives a condition for the equality of ratios of magnitudes in terms
of conditions only on natural numbers. Richard Dedekind was a 19th- and 20th-
century German mathematician famous for the &lsquo;&lsquo;Dedekind cut&rsquo;&rsquo;, a formal
construction of the reals from the rationals.</p>
<p>In the context of lengths, which is a first-class object in Greek mathematics,
there is no obvious &lsquo;&lsquo;base unit&rsquo;&rsquo; (like the inch), so a single line can't be
said to have rational or irrational length. It is only in finding the ratios of
lengths that this distinction appears. Euclid's algorithm can be used to find a
<b>unit</b> length for two longer lengths, so that each of the longer lengths is an
integer ratio of the unit length. But it is not always possible to find such a
unit length &ndash; in contemporary language it is only possible if the ratio of the
lengths is rational.  However, the Greeks did have a way of comparing two
ratios (that is, four lines, or two sets of two lines) for equality, and this
is given by Eudoxus.</p>
<h2>Eudoxus</h2>
<p>Eudoxus gives a way again to say whether two sets of lines have the same ratio,
even if they are not comensurable. Euclid states it as follows (cite this RSB):</p>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>Magnitudes are said to be in the same ratio, the first to the second and the
third to the fourth, when, if any equimultiples whatever be taken of the first
and third, and any equimultiples whatever of hte second and fourth, the former
equimultiples alike exceed, are alike equal to, or alike fall short of, the
latter equimultiples respectively takein in the corresponding order</p>
</div></div>
<p>That is, if I have two sets of lines &ndash; red and blue &ndash; to know if my red lines
are in the same ratio as my blue lines, I should pick any integer \(x\), and
repeat end-to-end the short lines \(x\) times. Then, I should pick any other
integer \(y\), and repeat end-to-end the long lines that many times. If no matter
which integers I chose, the relationship (shorter, longer, or the same length)
between the red repeated-short line and red repeated-long line is still the
same as that between the blue repeated-short line and the blue repeated-long
line, then the ratios are the same. In contemporary notation, we might say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} \leftrightarrow \left [ \forall x \forall y \left( xa \geq yb
\leftrightarrow xc \geq yd \right ) \right ]
\]
</p><p>for positive <b>integers</b> \(x\) and \(y\). A short proof of this fact using modern
language follows. Forward direction: let \(x\) and \(y\) be arbitrary integers and
\(a/b = c/d\). Then:</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{a}{b} &amp;= \frac{c}{d}\\
\frac{xa}{yb} &amp;= \frac{xc}{yd}
\end{align*}
\]
</p><p>This identity is useful in the following chain of coimplications:</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[
xa \geq yb \leftrightarrow \frac{xa}{yb} \geq 1 \leftrightarrow 
\frac{xc}{yd} \geq 1 \leftrightarrow xc \geq yd
\]
</p><p>This completes the forward direction. The reverse direction can be proven by
contradicition. Suppose that</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[\forall x \forall y \left (xa \geq yb \leftrightarrow xc \geq yd\right )\]
</p><p>but that, \(a/b \neq c/d\). Without loss of generality, \(a/b &lt; c/d\). Then there
is some rational \(q=m/n\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are integers, which lies between
them: \(a/b &lt; m/n &lt; c/d\). We may derive:</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[ a/b &lt; m/n \rightarrow na &lt; mb.\]
</p><p>And simultaneously</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[ c/d &gt; m/n \rightarrow nc &gt; md.\]
</p><p>Since we \(x\) and \(y\) are universally quantified, a contradiction is easily arrived at by letting \(x=n\) and \(y=m\).</p>
<h2>Eudoxus and Dedekind</h2>
<p>The Dedekind construction of the real numbers is to identify them with subsets
\(S\) of the rationals subject to the property that \(q \in S\) and \(p&lt;q\) implies
\(p \in S\). We can identify the real with the obvious limit point; for example,
\(\sqrt{2}\) is identified with the set of all rationals whose square is less
than 2.</p>
<p>Eudoxus doesn't give a single object which we might call a <b>real</b> &ndash; only a way
of comparing them. Such an object is not needed, because philosophically the
Greeks didn't consider these ratios to be first-class objects.  But suppose we
want to look at Eudoxus through this ontological lens. How might we turn an
equivalence relation into an object? Well, the Eudoxus condition for a pair of
ratios asks us to do an (infinite) sequence of tests, one for each pair drawn
from the positive integers, and compare all these results. So it seems to make
sense to consider an infinite table of these results as a single object, and
comparison between such objects is exactly comparison of each entry in the
table. For any ratio, we might think of an infinite table: each row corresponds
to to an integer by which we will repeat the shorter line; each column to an
integer by which we will repeat the longer line. In each cell of the table we
place &lsquo;&lsquo;\(&lt;\)&rsquo;&rsquo; or &lsquo;&lsquo;\(\geq\)&rsquo;&rsquo;, according the new relationship (so in the \(1,1\)
cell we place \(&lt;\)). This we identify with the ratio. Eudoxus&rsquo; condition that
two ratios are equal is exactly that the two corresponding tables are
identical.  The unification of these two formulations is straightforward: if
and only if the cell in row \(m\) and column \(n\) says &lsquo;&lsquo;\(&lt;\)&rsquo;&rsquo; in the Eudoxus
table, then add \(m/n\) to Dedekind's set. For example, consider two lines in the
ratio \(1:\sqrt{2}\).  Any value where</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[1\cdot m &lt; \sqrt{2} \cdot n\]
</p><p>must have</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[m^2 &lt; 2n^2\]
</p><p>and thus</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[(m/n)^2 &lt; 2\]
</p><p>which is exactly the condition for \(m/n\) to be in \(\sqrt{2}\)'s Dedekind cut.</p>
<p>The Eudoxus stack-\(m\)-and-\(n\) times step can be seen as a comparison to \(m/n\),
and the fact that Eudoxus requires the same relationship for <b>all</b> pairs of
integers can be seen as the equivalent of the downward-closure condition.  Once
we introduce the idea that we should have representative objects built out of
(infinitely many) integer- or rational- like objects which we identify with
reals (an idea which is perhaps ontological or philosophical, rather than
mathematical), the actually mathematics follows quickly &ndash; discovering the
above equivalence is not difficult.</p>
