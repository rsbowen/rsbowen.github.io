<h1>Greeks and Calculus: Eudoxus and Dedekind</h1>
</div>
<p>I think it is well-known among people who like math that the Greeks were not
that far from the beginnings of what we now call calculus or analysis &ndash; for
example, Archimedes is understood the convergence of geometric series and the
method of exhaustion is very close to what we now call limits. If you squint,
you'll even find integrals in his work.</p>
<p>In an undergraduate math history course, I was pleasantly surprised by some of
these examples. However, I haven't found anywhere on the web which collects
them &ndash; that is the purpose of this project. On this page you will find the
details of the similarity between an early definition of equality of ratios and
a millenia-later foundational definition of the real numbers.</p>

<h2>The Main Players</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudoxus_of_Cnidus" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Eudoxus of Cnidus</a> was a 4th-
and 3rd- century BC Greek mathematician. In Euclid, he gives a condition for
the equality of ratios of magnitudes in terms of conditions only on natural
numbers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dedekind" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Richard Dedekind</a> was a 19th- and 20th- century German mathematician
famous for the &lsquo;&lsquo;Dedekind cut&rsquo;&rsquo;, a formal construction of the reals from the
rationals.</p>
<p>In the context of lengths, which is a first-class object in Greek mathematics,
there is no obvious &lsquo;&lsquo;base unit&rsquo;&rsquo; (like the inch), so a single line can't be
said to have rational or irrational length. It is only in finding the ratios of
lengths that this distinction appears. Euclid's algorithm can be used to find a
<b>unit</b> length for two longer lengths, so that each of the longer lengths is an
integer ratio of the unit length. But it is not always possible to find such a
unit length &ndash; in contemporary language it is only possible if the ratio of the
lengths is rational.  However, the Greeks did have a definition for comparing
two ratios (that is, four lines, or two sets of two lines) for equality &ndash; even
in the incommensurable case &ndash;, and this is given by Eudoxus.  </p>
<h2>Eudoxus</h2>
<p>Euclid states what I call the Eudoxus condition as follows (Boyer, Carl B. <i>The
History of the Calculus and Its Conceptual Development</i>. New York: Dover, 1959.
31.):</p>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>Magnitudes are said to be in the same ratio, the first to the second and the
third to the fourth, when, if any equimultiples whatever be taken of the first
and third, and any equimultiples whatever of the second and fourth, the former
equimultiples alike exceed, are alike equal to, or alike fall short of, the
latter equimultiples respectively taken in the corresponding order</p>
</div></div>
<p>I find this a little difficult to parse, so here is an example. Suppose I have
two sets of lines &ndash; red and blue &ndash; and I'd like to know if the red lines&rsquo;
lengths are in the same ratio as the blue:</p>
<table class="imgtable"><tr><td>
<img src="pair_of_ratios.svg" alt="A pair of ratios, represented as four line segments -- two red, and two blue" width="100%" />&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"></td></tr></table>
<p>I can pick any pair of positive integers, \(x\) and \(y\). I repeat the shorter red
line \(x\) times and the shorter blue line \(x\) times. I repeat the longer red
line \(y\) times and the longer blue line \(y\) times. Here is the above example
with \(x=3\) and \(y=2\).</p>
<table class="imgtable"><tr><td>
<img src="eudoxus_counterexample.svg" alt="The same pair of ratios, with the 'numerator' and 'denominator' repeated three times and two times respectively; the red repeated-numerator is longer than the red repeated-denominator, but the blue repeated-numerator is shorter than the blue repeated-denominator." width="100%" />&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"></td></tr></table>
<p>In this case the repeated-short-red line is longer than the
repeated-long-red-line, but the repeated-short-blue-line is still shorter than
the repeated-long-blue-line. This means the ratios are unequal. If I can find
no such pair \(x,y\), then the ratios are equal. In contemporary notation, we
might say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} \leftrightarrow \left [ \forall x \forall y \left( xa \geq yb
\leftrightarrow xc \geq yd \right ) \right ]
\]
</p><p>for positive <b>integers</b> \(x\) and \(y\). A short proof of this fact using modern
language follows. Forward direction: let \(x\) and \(y\) be arbitrary integers and
\(a/b = c/d\). Then:</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{a}{b} &amp;= \frac{c}{d}\\
\frac{xa}{yb} &amp;= \frac{xc}{yd}
\end{align*}
\]
</p><p>This identity is useful in the following chain of biconditionals:</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[
xa \geq yb \leftrightarrow \frac{xa}{yb} \geq 1 \leftrightarrow 
\frac{xc}{yd} \geq 1 \leftrightarrow xc \geq yd
\]
</p><p>This completes the forward direction. The reverse direction can be proven by
contraposition. Let \(a/b \neq c/d\). Without loss of generality, \(a/b &lt; c/d\).
Then is some rational \(q=m/n\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are integers, which lies between
them: \(a/b &lt; m/n &lt; c/d\). We may derive:</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[ a/b &lt; m/n \rightarrow na &lt; mb.\]
</p><p>And simultaneously</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[ c/d &gt; m/n \rightarrow nc &gt; md.\]
</p><p>Then \((n,m)\) is a witness which shows the existence of a pair \((x,y)\) where</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[ \exists x \exists y \left ( xa \geq yb \not \leftrightarrow xc \geq yd \right ). \]
</p><h2>Eudoxus and Dedekind</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_cut" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Dedekind construction of the real numbers</a> is to identify them with subsets
\(S\) of the rationals subject to the property that \(q \in S\) and \(p&lt;q\) implies
\(p \in S\). We can identify the real with the obvious limit point; for example,
\(\sqrt{2}\) is identified with the set of all rationals whose square is less
than 2.</p>
<p>Eudoxus doesn't give a single object which we might call a <b>real</b> &ndash; only a way
of comparing them. Such an object is not needed, because philosophically the
Greeks didn't consider these ratios to be first-class objects.  But suppose we
want to look at Eudoxus through this ontological lens. How might we turn an
equivalence relation into an object? Well, the Eudoxus condition for a pair of
ratios asks us to do an (infinite) sequence of tests, one for each pair drawn
from the positive integers, and compare all these results. So it seems to make
sense to consider an infinite table of these results as a single object, and
comparison between such objects is exactly comparison of each entry in the
table. For any ratio, we might think of an infinite table: each row corresponds
to to an integer by which we will repeat the shorter line; each column to an
integer by which we will repeat the longer line. In each cell of the table we
place &lsquo;&lsquo;\(&lt;\)&rsquo;&rsquo; or &lsquo;&lsquo;\(\geq\)&rsquo;&rsquo;, according the new relationship (so in the \(1,1\)
cell we place \(&lt;\)). This we identify with the ratio. Eudoxus&rsquo; condition that
two ratios are equal is exactly that the two corresponding tables are
identical.  The unification of these two formulations is straightforward: if
and only if the cell in row \(m\) and column \(n\) says &lsquo;&lsquo;\(&lt;\)&rsquo;&rsquo; in the Eudoxus
table, then add \(m/n\) to Dedekind's set. For example, consider two lines in the
ratio \(1:\sqrt{2}\).  Any value where</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[1\cdot m &lt; \sqrt{2} \cdot n\]
</p><p>must have</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[m^2 &lt; 2n^2\]
</p><p>and thus</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[(m/n)^2 &lt; 2\]
</p><p>which is exactly the condition for \(m/n\) to be in \(\sqrt{2}\)'s Dedekind cut.</p>
<p>The Eudoxus stack-\(m\)-and-\(n\) times step can be seen as a comparison to \(m/n\),
and the fact that Eudoxus requires the same relationship for <b>all</b> pairs of
integers can be seen as the equivalent of the downward-closure condition.  Once
we introduce the idea that we should have representative objects built out of
(infinitely many) integer- or rational- like objects which we identify with
reals (an idea which is perhaps ontological or philosophical, rather than
mathematical), the actually mathematics follows quickly &ndash; discovering the
above equivalence is not difficult.</p>
