# RSB Crosswords
*[Click here to solve the puzzles in your browser!](/crosswords/www/index.html)*

Here are some crossword puzzles I have constructed. Please send any comments to me at (rsbowen at gmail dot com). If you'd like to solve them in your **browser**, you can use my instance of [Robert Schroll's 'crosswords’ HTML5 app](http://rschroll.github.io/crosswords/), a free-software app (GPL) which works reasonably well on most modern desktop and mobile browsers. I also have two other formats available: .puz and .pdf. The latter is suitable for printing, and there are many ways to open a .puz file:

  * Shortyz: On **Android** devices, you can use the venerable free-software crossword app, [shortyz](http://www.kebernet.net/Home/projects/shortyz). Opening arbitrary .puz files from the web on shortyz is a little involved, see these [instructions](https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/111840/can-i-load-puzzles-manually-in-shortyz-without-an-internet-connectiona).
  * xword: On **Linux**, [xword](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wx-xword/) is the standard for displaying .puz files. It's probably available from your distribution's package manager.
  * [Across Lite](http://www.litsoft.com/): Available for **Windows**, **Mac**, and **iPad**.

## The Referee
A very silly crossword (hint: start with 18-Across!). This one is a little weird and has some squares which are only clued by one direction. If you find that your .puz viewer is rendering these squares with a number (e.g., if you have a one-square 19-Down), use referee_blanks.puz, which has empty clues inserted. (If you use the wrong one, all the clue numbers will be off by one or two!)

## And Co
A small crossword inspired by a trip to Denver – with a few local-knowledge clues.
