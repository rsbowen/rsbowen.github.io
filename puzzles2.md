# RSB Crosswords
[Quick link to online solving](/crosswords/www/index.html)

Here are some crossword puzzles I have constructed. Please send any comments to me at (rsbowen at gmail dot com). If you'd like to solve them in your **browser**, you can use my instance of [http://rschroll.github.io/crosswords/](Robert Schroll's 'crosswords’ HTML5 app), a free-software app (GPL) which works reasonably well on most modern desktop and mobile browsers. I also have two other formats available: .puz and .pdf. The latter is suitable for printing, and there are many ways to open a .puz file:

  * Shortyz: On **Android** devices, you can use the venerable free-software crossword app, shortyz. Opening arbitrary .puz files from the web on shortyz is a little involved, see these instructions.
  * xword: On **Linux**, xword is the standard for displaying .puz files. It's probably available from your distribution's package manager.
  * Across Lite: Available for **Windows**, **Mac**, and **iPad**.

## The Referee
A very silly crossword (hint: start with 18-Across!). This one is a little weird and has some squares which are only clued by one direction. If you find that your .puz viewer is rendering these squares with a number (e.g., if you have a one-square 19-Down), use referee_blanks.puz, which has empty clues inserted. (If you use the wrong one, all the clue numbers will be off by one or two!)
